To start this game, go to your browser and click on the "file" menu and select "open..." and select the file "index.html"

To use your own questions and answers and make other modifications to this game, open the file QandA.js in a text editor
	Questions and Answers are the bulk of this file. The format should be pretty obvious. 
	The category names are at the bottom of this file.
	The amount of time given per question is at the bottom of this file.
	The title of the game can be set at the bottom of this file.
	Other options can be set in this file.
	

Note 1 : If either your question or answer needs to include any double quote marks, you should put a backwards slash before it.
So "test" should be \"test\"

Example:
var cat1 = new Array(
    new qAndA(100, "This is a \"test\" phrase.", "The word test should be in quotes!"),
    ...
);

The double quote marks already included should not be altered.


Note 2: I have tested this game informally using Internet Explorer 6.x and Mozilla 1.5 with success.
